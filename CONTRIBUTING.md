## Autogenerated files

Some files are autogenerated, and included in git so that the project
may be built with a naive `go get ...`.

These generated files can be regenerated with `make generate`, and the
updated generated files should also be included in the PR that
modified the input files.

## Managing vendor/

TL;DR: run `make vendor` whenever you add/remove a dependency. run `GO111MODULE=on go get -u .....` to update deps.

This project uses `go mod`, Go modules feature implemented since Go 1.11. This feature needs to be turned on explicitly via the `GO111MODULE` env variable, if you checkout the `kubecfg` repo in its canonical location in the GOPATH (i.e. $GOPATH/github.com/kubecfg/kubecfg).  This feature is turned on _automatically_ if you checkout the `kubecfg` repo anywhere else in the filesystem.


This repository is configured to use Go modules as a source of truth for dependency information,
but to rely on vendoring to resolve the dependencies during build.

It's thus possible to build `kubecfg` directly with `go build` if the repo is checked out in the GOPATH (which makes it `go get`table too), or when it's checked out outside the GOPATH.

In order to make sure that the `vendor/` directory is kept up to date, the `Makefile`
instructs `go build` to consume the modules from the vendored directory (via `-mod=vendor` flag) as opposed to fetching the modules in the user's cache. That flag is available only if GO111MODULE is turned on, but effectvely turns the build into a legacy pre-Go-modules build.

If you're familiar with Go modules, feel free to build `kubecfg` with go build or test directly, but please check in vendored repository (the CI build will likely catch you if you forget):

```
$ make vendor
```

To make things easier for reviewers, put updates to `vendor/` in a separate commit within the same PR if possible.

### Clean up removed/unnecessary dependencies

This is a good one to run before sending a non-trivial change for
review.

```
# See unused
govendor list +unused

# Remove unused
govendor remove +unused
```

### Add a new dependency

Make code change that imports new library, then:

```
# See missing
govendor list +missing

% govendor fetch -v +missing
```

Note pinning a library to a specific version requires extra work.  In
particular, we do this for `client-go` and `apimachinery` - to find
the current version used for these libraries, look in
`vendor/vendor.json` for the `version` field (not `versionExact`) of
an existing package.  Use that same version in the commands below:

```
# For example: To pin all imported client-go packages to release v3.0
% govendor fetch -v k8s.io/client-go/...@v3.0

# *Note* the above may pull in new packages from client-go, which will
# be imported at HEAD.  You need to re-run the above command until
# all imports are at the desired version.
# TODO: There is probably a better way to do this.
```

It is safe (and appropriate) to re-run `govendor fetch` with a
different version, if you made a mistake or missed some libraries.

## Making a Release

1. Add appropriate tag.  We do this via git (not github UI) so the tag
   is signed.  This process requires you to have write access to the
   real master branch (not your local fork).
   ```
   % tag=vX.Y.Z
   % git fetch   # update
   % git tag -s -m $tag $tag origin/master
   % git push origin tag $tag
   ```

2. Wait for the travis autobuilders to build release binaries.

3. *Now* create the github release, using the existing tag created
   above.
